/// Declares Unit IDs for units that are not public (ie. registered with STIVAMA
/// and located in one of the header files in VDR/Interface), but which
/// should be accessible from applications specific to the "DemoBoard" project.
/// Such applications will only work with a driver compiled from "DemoBoard"!
/// General (= normal!) applications must only include public unit IDs from VDR/Interface!
///
/// Word of warning: All Custom Unit IDs must be unique within the Custom/ branch!!!!
